## 📥 Installation  

### 🖌️ Installing a Theme  

1. **Put the "Theme" folder in the root of LittleFS** *(do not put it on the SD card, as this can cause graphic bugs with the theme)*.
2. Go to **Config → UI Theme** and select the file **"Theme.json"**.
3. Ready! The theme was successfully installed.

### 🎬 Changing the Boot Animation  

There are currently three boot animation options available: 

- **Dedsec animation edited by Wendell Silva**
- **Bruce animation created by Ali Akkok** 
- **Flipper-Inspired Bruce animation created by Ali Akkok** 

To change the boot animation:

1. Choose the **"boot.gif"** file of the desired animation.
2. Resize it to your device's resolution.
3. Copy the file to the **root of LittleFS or SD card**.
4. Restart the device to apply the new animation.
